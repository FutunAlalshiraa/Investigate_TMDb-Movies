# Investigate_TMDb-Movies
This project aim to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. By using Python libraries CSV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier by building  data visualizations 

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

We recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. 

Why this Project?
This project will go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Data Analysis Process: <br></br>
1- Rasing or building questions on your dataset<br></br>
2- Data Wringling (data cleaning)<br></br>
3- Exploring your data<br></br>
4- Drawing conclusion or findings about your data <br></br>
5- Communicate your findings<br></br>

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
